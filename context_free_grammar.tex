Given \emph{S}, a finite set of security groups, the language our mechanism operates on can be generated by a context free grammar. Because the language is dependent on the security groups \emph{S}, this grammar must be generated based on it. This is done in two steps:

First, we define the base grammar:\\

\tab $G^1 = (V^1, \Sigma^1, R^1, \mathcal{A})$, where

\tab $V^1 = \{\mathcal{A} , W\}$ \hfill non-terminal symbols \hspace*{6em}

\tab $\Sigma ^1 = \{ \emptyset\}$ \hfill terminal symbols\hspace*{6.3em}

\tab $R^1 = \lbrace \hspace*{1.35em}\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \varepsilon ,$ \hfill rules of production \hspace*{6em} \\
$\tab \hspace*{5.9em} \mathcal{A}\rightarrow W\mathcal{A} |W\rbrace$\\

This base grammar, through the non-terminal symbols and production rules, establishes a means of generating the base language form of unordered windows ($W\in V^1$) in an arbitrary length such as $WW$ or $WWWWW$.

Next, we generate the \emph{S} specific definitions:\\


\tab $G^2 = (V^2, \Sigma^2, R^2, \emptyset)$, where

\tab $V^2 =\{W\}$

\tab $\Sigma ^2 = \{[o_{s,i}, a_{s,i}]:\forall i \in \forall s\in \emph{S}\}$

\tab $R^2 = \{[W\rightarrow \Bigg (\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{\forall i\in s} o_{s,i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=1}^{\forall j\in s} a_{s,i}\Bigg ) ] :\forall s\in \emph{S}\}$


These definitions add new terminal symbols and the necessary production rules to generate them. 

The terminal symbols are of the form $o_{s,i}$ and $a_{s,i}$. $o_{s,i}$ represents an open command issued to a compute node $i$ within security group $s$. $a_{s,i}$ represents a corresponding acknowledgement.

The production rules are slightly more complex to generate. For every security group $s\in S$

With these symbols and the production rule $W_s\rightarrow o_sW_sa_s$ the grammar is now capable of filling the windows $W$ with open and acknowledgement messages that allow a single security group to communicate within a windows.

Finally, the language our mechanism accepts for security group \emph{S} can be formed using the union of the previous two grammars:\\

\tab $G = (V, \Sigma , R, \mathcal{A})$, where

\tab $V = V^1\cup V^2$

\tab $\Sigma = \Sigma ^1\cup \Sigma ^2$

\tab $R = R^1\cup R^2$
