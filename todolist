Token - token pasing? 
	Dist. OS book
	"lease" on resources?
	Terminology from dist OS
*****
	We are creating a channel access method
		The mechanism enforces time division multiplexing among numerous compute nodes. 
		

Discrete Math w/ temporal logic
	define mutual exclusion
	
What principles are required by our mechanism? What solves the problem?
	inability to communicate?
	inability to see communication?
	can we have an A to B to C problem?
	inability to interfere with other programs?

Writing process
	Create physical notes
	convert to text
	What should be formally specified, what shouldn't be?
	
More clearly define HPCaaS

Problem definition and environment definition
	Use dist. OS terminology
	formally define problem
	formally define system using components and properties the system satisfies
	specify trusted entities
	specify assumptions
		user programs have no root access on node
	with system model then define problem - data sharing, intuitive solution
	
Create simple proof on token passing finite state machines
	create carefully defined FSMs
		Consider making differing levels of complexity
	use code generator to show our system adheres 
	specify the problems that token passing systems can encounter: token lost, stolen token (signed communication between sec group and controller), forged tokens
	How can central server be attacked?
